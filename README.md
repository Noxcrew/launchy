## Instructions

The installer cannot be downloaded as we only distribute it to participants playing in the MC Championship event. These sources are public to contribute our additions back to the open source ecosystem that created this project and for others to use our work and create their own versions.

## Features
- Installs fabric into a 'MC Championship' profile
- Allows you to choose recommended mods by group or individually
- Installs to the default mods folder and doesn't touch other present mods
- Looks for updates for the mods on startup

# FAQ

### My game uses my default mods folder
- On Linux, Flatpak users should make sure the Minecraft Launcher has access to `~/.mcclaunchy` (you may need to allow access to the entire home directory)
